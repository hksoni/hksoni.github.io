In January 2023, I joined Puneet Sharma's Networking & Distributed Systems Lab (NDSL) at <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hewlett-packard-labs.html" target="_blank">Hewlett-Packard-Labs</a> as a Research Scientist. 

Earlier, I worked at NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH for two years. I was a post-doctoral research associate at the Computer Science department of  <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a> from 2018 to 2020.  I worked with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/" target="_blank">Nate Foster</a>. Before joining Cornell, I was a PhD student advised by [Thierry Turletti](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/thierry-turletti/) and [Walid Dabbous](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/walid-dabbous/) in the [DIANA](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/) team at [INRIA Sophia, France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee).  I received my PhD in Informatique from [l’UNIVERSITÉ CÔTE D’AZUR](http://univ-cotedazur.fr/fr).  Earlier I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Alcatel-Lucent India for a couple of years.

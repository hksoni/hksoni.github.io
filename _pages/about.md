I am a post-doctoral research associate at Computer Science department
of <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, USA. 
I am working with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/" target="_blank">Nate Foster</a>.
Prior to joining Cornell, I was a PhD student advised by 
[Thierry Turletti](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/thierry-turletti/) and
[Walid Dabbous](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/walid-dabbous/) in
[DIANA](https://team.inria.fr/diana/team-members/)
team at [INRIA Sophia, France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee). 
I received my PhD in Informatique from [l’UNIVERSITÉ CÔTE D’AZUR](http://univ-cotedazur.fr/fr). 
Earlier, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Alcatel-Lucent, India.


My primary research interests are systems and networking. Current focus is on
software-defined and programmable networks. The state-of-the-art packet-processing
languages and hardware architectures lack mechanisms that allow to create code 
libraries and reuse them. My research aims to enable modular programming by 
designing languages and developing compilers for packet-processing targets. I 
work at intersection of networking, systems, compilers and programming languages.
